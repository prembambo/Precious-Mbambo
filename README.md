# 👋 Hi, I’m Precious Mbambo

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!

I’m a **Junior Web Developer in training**, currently transitioning from over 10 years of experience in Human Resources into the tech world. I’m passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems—especially in areas like job creation, accessibility, and education.

While I’m still learning, I’m excited to grow my skills, build meaningful projects, and share my progress with the world.
